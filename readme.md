# MonStats BETA - Compare Puzzle and Dragons Monsters!

In order to compare the growth per level for several monsters, I implemented
this simple and mobile friendly tool.

## TODO
A lot can be done to improve the general UX.

* store monster data in local storage (and offer to refetch after a while)
* refactor codebase into nice services
* keep track of adding/deleting series to keep colors consisten
* offer more elaborate search
* speed up page load times by minifying and reducing used libraries
* and many more
