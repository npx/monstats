# MonStats BETA - Compare Puzzle and Dragons Monsters!

In order to compare the growth per level for several monsters, I implemented
this simple and mobile friendly tool.

## TODO
A lot can be done to improve the general UX.

* ~~store monster data in local storage (and offer to refetch after a while)~~
* ~~refactor codebase into nice services~~
* ~~keep track of adding/deleting series to keep colors consistent~~
* offer more elaborate search
* speed up page load times by ~~minifying~~ and reducing used libraries
